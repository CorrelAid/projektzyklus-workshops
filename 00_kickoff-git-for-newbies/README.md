# Git for newbies

Live workshop at the project cycle kickoff event.

Please follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/CorrelAid/git-newbie-playground) in the days before the workshop - otherwise you won't be able to participate in the hands-on exercises!

The slides can be found [here](https://correlaid.github.io/projektzyklus-workshops/00_kickoff-git-for-newbies/slides.html)

The material is based roughly on Frie Preu's [Git your sh*t together workshop](https://frie.codes/gost.html).
